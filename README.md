files task(1-4).py  are contained implemented decorators for different functions (I use global dict-s for detecting the number of calls and ranking by execution time)
the entire task description can be found on: https://moodle.innopolis.university/my/

task3.py  - creates text files with description
and the standard output displays the rank

task4.py - contains a try exception block for error messages - writes them to the file "name_func + error.txt"

main.py - here are some functions for the decorator test (pascal triangle and quadratic equation and two functions using lambda expressions are present) you can also add your own functions with errors inside for testing decorator_4)
python main.py a command in the terminal will run a test of all functions at once

if you want to check a specific decorator, you can call functions that are extended by this decorator
